# ePaper display Ã— ResinOS

This renders [a calendar web page](https://the-day-today.glitch.me/) screenshot every minute using headless-Chromium. The screenshot is saved at a 2.7 inch epaper display resolution (169,264 px) which is then sent to hte connected epaper display.

Some screenshot file is hashed and the screen will not be updated if the hash matches the last image saved.

## Background 

This is based on the [`resin-io-playground/resinio-PaPiRus`](https://github.com/resin-io-playground/resinio-PaPiRus) Dockerfile here adapted to work on Debian Stretch (Pi2 / 3) or Raspbian Stretch (Pi 1 / Zero).

Although this is intended for the [PaPiRus](https://www.pi-supply.com/product/papirus-epaper-eink-screen-hat-for-raspberry-pi/) HAT, it successfully works with the [Percheron Electronics E-paper HAT](http://www.percheron-electronics.uk/shop/e-paper-hat/).

## Why

The [`PiSupply/PaPiRus`](https://github.com/PiSupply/PaPiRus) is nice as it gives you Python scripts for various demos and functionality. For example, `papirus-draw image.png -r 180` will render an image rotated 180 degrees to the display. `papirus-clear` will clear the display. This is in addition to the Python2.7 API.
